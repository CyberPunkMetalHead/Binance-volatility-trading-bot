## READ BEFORE USE
1. If you use the `TEST_MODE: False` in your config, you will be using REAL money.
2. To ensure you do not do this, ALWAYS check the `TEST_MODE` configuration item in the config.yml file..
3. This is a framework for users to modify and adapt to their overall strategy and needs, and in no way a turn-key solution.
4. Depending on the current market, the default config might not do much, so you will have to adapt it to your own strategy.
