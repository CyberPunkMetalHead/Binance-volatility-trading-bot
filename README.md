# Binance Volitility Trading Bot

## Description
This Binance trading bot analyses the changes in price across allÂ coins on Binance and place trades on the most volatile ones. 
In addition to that, this Binance trading algorithm will also keep track of all the coins bought and sell them according to your specified Stop Loss and Take Profit.



The bot will listen to changes in price accross all coins on Binance. By default, we're only picking USDT pairs. We're excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs

> Information below is an example and is all configurable

- The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
- The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
- The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss

## READ BEFORE USE
1. If you use the `TEST_MODE: False` in your config, you will be using REAL money.
2. To ensure you do not do this, ALWAYS check the `TEST_MODE` configuration item in the config.yml file..
3. This is a framework for users to modify and adapt to their overall strategy and needs, and in no way a turn-key solution.
4. Depending on the current market, the default config might not do much, so you will have to adapt it to your own strategy.
